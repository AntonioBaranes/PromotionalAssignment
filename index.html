	<p class = "textbox"> The Sound Track is just excellent! <br> Compossed by Shoji Meguro, it spans multiple genres including rock, pop, and jazz. <br> The catchy tracks are excellent at invigorating the player during combat and set an amazing atmosphere during gameplay. </p>

		The characters from Persona 5 are widely beloved by the community for their depth, complexity, and relatability.<br> Each character and their personalities are thoroughly developed through the games plot and confidant system, a unique system that rewards players for spending time with characters outside of the main story.<br> Each character's confidant ark explores their inner struggles and sees them grow thus giving the player a deeper connection to them.<br> The strong story and confidant system allow players to develop connections to these characters. <br> Personally, Yusuke is my favorite.

	<p class = "head">#3 The Time Managment System</p>

<div class = "organizer">
	<p class = "textbox">
		Persona 5 implores a very unique day to day system that allows players to perform a certain amount of actions before the day ends.<br> This makes it so that the player has to think about what they're going to do that day.<br> This presents a layer of players-player unique experiences that not many games achieve.<br> Different players will have completely different experiences playing the game depending on how they decide to manage their time which I think is really cool.<br> The system also demonstrating the passing days really makes the player feel that time is passing which helps immersion in a way only a video game could.  
	</P>

	<p class = "head">#4 The UI is SO Stylish</p>

<div class = "organizer">
	<img class = "picture" src="ui.gif" alt ="GIF of game UI in Action">
</div>

<div class = "organizer">
	<p class = "textbox">
		Just look at the GIF.<br> I know the image quality is questionable but like GOD DAMN!<br> The way the menus move is so slick with Joker (the main character) changing poses!<br> The red, black, and white asthetic in conjunction to the pattern changes is mind numbingly good!<br> I'm not an aartisically inclined person but even I know this is something else!

	<p class = "head">#5 The 1 More/Baton Pass System</p>

<div class = "organizer">

<div class = "organizer">
	<p id = "baton" class = "textbox">
		Persona 5 is a turn based rpg which means that the player can take their time chosing what action they will take.<br>The same system is used in the extremely popular pokemon games.<br> This includes the type effectiveness system used in them too.<br> Think of how if you hit a grass type with a fire move it would be super effective in pokemon.<br> The same is true for persona but the system goes even further.<br> When an enemy is hit by a move they are weak to the attacking party member is granted a One More.<br> As the name implies it gives them one more action before their turn ends.<br> However, this extra turn can be given to a different party member while also buffing their attack in what's called a baton pass.<br> Then this party member can attack a different enemy with a weakness and keep passing the baton.<br> The more the baton is passed the higher the attack buff.<br> If all enemies are downed the party can unleash a devastating AOE (area of effect/attacks all enemies on field) called an all out attack.<br> By using the one more, baton pass, and all out attack, one can end an encounter before even getting hit which conserves the parties hp.<br> This system, which as far as I know is unique to Persona 5, heavily favors strategy and finding an opponents weakness and is also so fun!<br> 
		Also, I know I'm sorry about the image quality again but it shows the mechanic off pretty well.
		Also also, I know this paragraph is long as hell I just really like this system.
